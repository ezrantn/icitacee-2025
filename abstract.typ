This research presents a decentralized platform for academic credential verification using blockchain technology. The system allows students to store and share their school diplomas in a secure, tamper-evident format. By leveraging smart contracts, diploma issuance and verification are automated, enabling educational qualifications to be independently verified without manual intervention. The proposed system significantly reduces verification time, requiring only 400 milliseconds for an individual diploma and less than 2 seconds for a complete document. These performance metrics demonstrate the system’s efficiency in real-world use. Employers can validate job applicants’ credentials directly through the blockchain, reducing administrative workload and improving trust in academic records. The solution benefits students, educational institutions, and employers alike by ensuring the authenticity and integrity of issued diplomas through a decentralized and transparent infrastructure.
