Beyond conventional paper-based techniques and even current digital systems, this paper has investigated a novel approach to academic diploma verification. We've created a platform that genuinely stands out by combining the strength of the Solana blockchain with IPFS decentralized storage and giving transparency, speed, and security top priority.

The results of our testing have been impressive: diplomas can be uploaded, rendered unchangeable, and their authenticity can be checked almost immediately (with transactions taking 400 milliseconds and the actual document being retrieved in less than 2 seconds). This outperforms other blockchain systems, which can be expensive and energy-intensive, and is a major improvement over slower, less secure conventional techniques. Imagine a world in which confirming a job applicant's diploma is as quick and simple as checking a phone, and you can be sure that the document is authentic.

Although there are comparable systems, such as Indonesia's SIVIL, they frequently fall short of our Solana/IPFS solution's strong, decentralized security and effectiveness. We have also shown that compared to many existing blockchain alternatives, our method is more scalable and eco-friendly.

The implementation of new technology has demonstrated benefits such as eliminating diploma fraud, reducing verification times, and providing a reliable record, opening the door for a new era of academic verification efficiency, despite the challenges posed by long-term data storage costs and widespread adoption.
