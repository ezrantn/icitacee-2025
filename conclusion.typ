The implementation of this decentralized diploma verification system, constructed on the Solana blockchain and IPFS, has effectively achieved its primary goals. When directly compared to established centralized systems such as SIVIL, our blockchain-based approach exhibits distinct superiority. The intrinsic application of blockchain technology inherently creates a decentralized server architecture, leading to expedited transaction processing and a fundamentally more secure framework for diploma verification. The system's performance on the testnet demonstrates its scalability and dependability, while user feedback underscores its significant potential for widespread adoption in the academic sector.

With further testing on the mainnet and further improvements based on user feedback, this system is set to transform the global verification of academic credentials, providing a significantly more secure, transparent, and efficient alternative to traditional methods like SIVIL.
