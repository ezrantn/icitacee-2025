The deployment of the decentralized diploma verification system utilizing Solana blockchain and IPFS has effectively achieved the objectives of improving security, transparency, and efficiency in the diploma verification process. The system's performance on the testnet illustrates its scalability and reliability, while user feedback underscores the potential for extensive adoption in the academic sector.

Through additional testing on the mainnet and ongoing enhancements informed by user feedback, this system could transform the global verification of academic credentials, providing a more secure, transparent, and efficient alternative to conventional centralized approaches.
